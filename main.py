# This is the main entry point for the MediaNexus FastAPI application.

# Initialize the FastAPI app

# Pydantic model for a basic message response

    Root endpoint for the API. Returns a welcome message.
    This can be used for health checks to see if the API is running.

# --- Next Steps ---
# The next steps in developing this file would be to:
# 1. Add API routers for different sections (e.g., settings, search, media).
# 2. Implement the database connection and models.
# 3. Create the API endpoints for all the features seen in the UI mockup.
# For example:
#
# from .routers import settings, search
#
# app.include_router(settings.router, prefix="/api/settings")
# app.include_router(search.router, prefix="/api/search")
